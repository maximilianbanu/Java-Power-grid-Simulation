Power Grid Simulatios
∠ The project consists of designing and simulating a fully-functioning power grid in Java and the actions and evolution of its
participating parties: consumers, providers and distributors.
∠ The simulation process works through the assessment of JSON input files, which function as a description of the evolution of each
participating party
∠ The system utilizes object-oriented design in order to facilitate easy management and observation of all the players implicated in
the simulation.
